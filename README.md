solution.pl - solve mazes by interpreting the maze as a grid, identifying free spaces, and constructing a graph. employs Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path from the start to the end point, using a queue to manage node visits. once the end point is reached, the program traces back the path, providing a solution to the maze

	input parameters are the following: first parameter is the maze and the second should be a list of actions that will solve the maze. the code will display the map layout and actions to solve the maze from start to finish.
